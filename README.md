--- BankingApp
This project is a simple banking application developed in C# as part of a Microsoft Learn exercise. It demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts
including class design, constructors, methods, extension methods, partial classes, static helpers, and object initialization.

--- Features
BankCustomer class with properties, methods, and a copy constructor
BankAccount class with deposit, withdrawal, transfer, interest, refund, and cashier's check operations
Extension methods for validating customer IDs and account status
Static helper class AccountCalculations for financial computations
Use of named and optional parameters in constructors
Object initializers and copy constructors for flexible object creation

--- Learning Objectives
Understand how to structure classes and methods in C#
Apply object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and inheritance
Use static classes and extension methods to organize reusable logic
Implement flexible constructors and object initialization patterns
